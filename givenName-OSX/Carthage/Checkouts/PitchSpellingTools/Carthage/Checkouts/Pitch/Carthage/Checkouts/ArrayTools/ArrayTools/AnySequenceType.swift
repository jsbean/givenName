/**
 Type erasing protocol that allows the `SequenceType` implementation to be left to the 
 individual `struct`.
 
 For example, `PitchSet` and `PitchSequence` are both containers for `Pitch` values, and should
 both be able to be used as `SequenceType` conforming structures. By conforming to this
 protocol, the `PitchSet` can use a `Set<Pitch>` as its underlying model, while `PitchSequence`
 can use an `Array<Pitch>` as its underlying model.
 
 In the conforming `struct`, it is necessary to add a private `var` which is an implementation
 of a `SequenceType` conforming `struct`, which is then given by the `sequence` getter. 
 
 In the `init` method of the conforming `struct`, set the value of this private `var` with the
 given `sequence.
