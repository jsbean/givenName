# PitchSpelling

## Background
`Pitch` values can often be represented multiple ways on a musical staff. 

> A `Pitch` with a `MIDI` note number of `61` (frequency of `277.18 Hz`) is one half-step above `middle c`. 
> 
> This pitch can be represented either as a `c sharp` or a `d flat`. Each representation is more appropriate for different contexts.

## Spelling preferrences

### Interval Optimization

`IntervalQuality` between two `PitchSpelling` values is the primary determinate of preference. 

| `IntervalQuality` | Preference |
| --- | --- |
| `diminished` | **undesired** |
| `minor` | **desired**  | 
| `perfect` | **desired**  |
| `major` | **desired**  |
| `augmented` | **undesired** |

> In the case of the `tritone`, `augmented fourth` and `diminished fifth` `IntervalQuality` values are necessary, and therefore acceptable.

#### A few examples

Consider the possibilities for representing a context in which an `a natural` is present along with the aforementioned `Pitch` of `MIDI` note number `61`:

| Pitch (nn: 57) | Pitch (nn: 61) | `IntervalQuality` |  Preference   |
| ----- | ------ | ----------------- | --- |
| `a natural` | `c sharp` | `major third` | **desired** |
| `a natural` | `d flat`  | `diminished fourth` | **undesired** |

> There is a clear preference, because the `Pitch` of `MIDI` note number `57` can only be spelled as an `a natural` (granted that we are disallowing `double flat` and `double sharp` `PitchSpelling` values).

However, consider a context in which the other `Pitch` also has multiple spelling representations, such as the `Pitch` of `MIDI`note number `56`:

| Pitch (nn: 56) | Pitch (nn: 61) | `IntervalQuality` |  Preference   |
| ----- | ------ | ----------------- | --- |
| `g sharp` | `c sharp` | `perfect fourth` | **desired** |
| `g sharp` | `d flat` | `diminished fifth` | **undesired** |
| `a flat` | `c sharp` | `augmented third`  | **undesired** |
| `a flat` | `d flat` | `perfect fourth` | **desired**  |

> Note that there are multiple desired options.

## High Resolution Pitch Spelling 

Currently, pitch spelling mechanisms are optimized for tonal music. In this case, one only considers 12 divisions of the octave. However, it is not uncommon for contemporary music to employ pitch material with more than 12 divisions of the octave.

There are a few additional preferences when spelling higher-resolution `Pitch` values.

### Fine Compatibility

In cases of eighth-step resolution `Pitch` values, it is preferred that the `fine.direction` (`up`, `down`) is compatible.

### Coarse Resolution Compatibility

In the case of eighth-step resolution `Pitch` values, which may be spelled with a quarter-step body (`a quarterSharp down`), it is preferred that the `coarse.resolution` (`quarterSharp`, `sharp`, `quarterFlat`, `flat`) is compatible.

## Structures

### PitchSet

A `PitchSet` is considered here an unordered, unique, unspelled collection of `Pitch` values. There is no inherent assumption that this `PitchSet` is a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal collection. 

### Dyads

By nature, a `PitchSet` is composed of _<sub>n</sub>C<sub>2</sub>_ `Dyad` values (pairs of `Pitch` values). 

**Example:**

Consider a pitch set with `MIDI` note number values `[62, 63, 66, 67]`:

```Swift

let pitchSet: PitchSet = [
  Pitch(noteNumber: 62),
  Pitch(noteNumber: 63), 
  Pitch(noteNumber: 66), 
  Pitch(noteNumber: 67)
]
```

In this case, there are 6 `Dyad` values:

```Swift
[(62, 63), (62, 66), (62, 67), (63, 66), (63, 67), (66, 67)]
```

### Nodes, Edges, Stacks, Rankings

In order to keep track of spelling preferences when there is no clear answer, certain data structures have been created:

| Structure | Note        |
|-----------|-------------|
| [`PitchSpellingNode`](https://github.com/dn-m/PitchSpellingTools/blob/bean-horizontal/PitchSpellingTools/PitchSpellingNode.swift) |  Wraps a single `PitchSpelling` and its `Pitch`, with a `rank` |
| [`PitchSpellingEdge`](https://github.com/dn-m/PitchSpellingTools/blob/bean-horizontal/PitchSpellingTools/PitchSpellingEdge.swift) | Combination of a single pair of `PitchSpellingNode` values from a `Dyad`, with a `rank` |
| [`PitchSpellingStack`](https://github.com/dn-m/PitchSpellingTools/blob/bean-horizontal/PitchSpellingTools/PitchSpellingStack.swift) | Collection of all `PitchSpellingNode` objects for a given `Pitch` |
| [`Ranker`](https://github.com/dn-m/PitchSpellingTools/blob/bean-horizontal/PitchSpellingTools/PitchSpellingRanking.swift)  | Ranks all possible `PitchSpellingNode` or `PitchSpellingEdge` options for a given `Dyad` |

### Ranking Potential Spellings and Potential Spelling Pairs

Both `PitchSpellingNode` and `PitchSpellingEdge` objects may be ranked. 

When no conclusive spelling can be found for a given `PitchSet` (i.e., when no `Pitch` values therein are objectively spellable), the `rank` value of `PitchSpellingEdge` values are consulted to determine an otherwise ambiguous context.

### Rankers

There are **three cases** possible when attempting to spell a `Dyad`:

1. Both `Pitch` values can be spelled objectively: `(60, 67)`
2. One `Pitch` value can be spelled objectively: `(62, 63), (66, 67)`
3. Neither `Pitch` value can be spelled objectively: `(63, 66)`

#### Case 1: DeterminatePitchSpellingRanker

The `DeterminatePitchSpellingRanker` applies an optimum `rank` of `1.0` to both `PitchSpellingNode` values.

#### Case 2: SemiAmbiguousPitchSpellingRanker

The `SemiAmbiguousPitchSpellingRanker` ranks each possible `PitchSpellingNode` for a given ambiguously spellable `PitchSpellingStack`, given the context of an objectively spellable `PitchSpellingNode`.

Each `PitchSpellingNode` from the ambiguously spellable `PitchSpellingStack` is penalized for breaking a given set of rules when contextualized by the objectively spellable `PitchSpellingNode`.

#### Case 3: FullyAmbiguousPitchSpellingRanker

The `FullyAmbiguousPitchSpellingRanker` ranks each possible `PitchSpellingEdge` between each possible `PitchSpellingNode` from each ambiguously spellable `PitchSpellingStack`.

Each `PitchSpellingEdge` is penalized if it breakings any of a given set of rules within its own context.

# PitchSetSpeller

## Goal
Find the optimum way to spell the `Pitch` values comprising a `PitchSet`.

For our purposes, this algorithm is to handle cases of `Pitch` values with a resolution of up to an eighth-step (48 divisions of the octave).

## Process

#### 1. Prepare `Dyad` values

Sort `Dyad` values for the given `PitchSet` by `spelling priority` of its `IntervalClass`.

> By attempting to spell `Dyad` values with certain `IntervalClass` values first, the most salient relationships are prioritized, and are therefore preserved in their graphical representation.

> To see the details of the ordering, look [here](https://github.com/dn-m/PitchSpellingTools/blob/bean-comparisonstage/PitchSpellingTools/IntervalClass%2BPitchSpelling.swift). 

**Example:**
For the case above, the dyads are now ordered as such:

```Swift
[(62, 63), (66, 67), (62, 67), (62, 66), (63, 67), (63, 66)]
```

The order of applying rules is important, as the weight of the penalties applied to each `Dyad` decreases throughout the iterative process.

> <img src="https://github.com/dn-m/PitchSpellingTools/blob/bean-horizontal/Documentation/img/62_63.jpg" height="240">

For example, the penalty applied to the `d sharp` `PitchSpellingNode` in the above graphic is more severe than those applied to the `PitchSpellingNode` objects for the `Dyad` values ranked afterward.

#### 2. Create `PitchSpellingRanking` structure for each `Dyad`
For each `Dyad` in the given `PitchSet`: 
- Create the appropriate `PitchSpellingRanking` structure:
  - `Determinate`
  - `SemiAmbiguous`
  - `FullyAmbiguous`

#### 3. Apply rankings to `PitchSpellingNode` objects

For each `PitchSpellingRanking` structure:
- Apply rankings to `PitchSpellingNode` objects contained therein (`Determinate` / `SemiAmbiguous`) or `PitchSpellingEdge` (`FullyAmbiguous`).

> In the case that there are no objectively spellable `Pitch` values in the given `PitchSet`, no `PitchSpellingNode` objects are ranked. 
>
> Instead, the `PitchSpellingEdge` objects are ranked.

#### 4. Apply rankings of `PitchSpellingEdge` objects to `PitchSpellingNode` objects
Penalize the `PitchSpellingNode` objects that are found in poorest-rated `PitchSpellingEdge` objects.

#### 5. `return`
Return the the set composed of the spellings of the highest ranked `PitchSpellingNode` for each `Pitch`.

# PitchSequenceSpeller

> Work-in-progress

## Goal
Find the optimum way to spell a sequence of vertical `PitchSet` values.

> **TODO:** Determine rules for segmentation

### Thoughts on sub-segmentation

- F = FullyAmbiguouslySpellablePitchSet (0 pitches in PitchSet objectively spellable)
- S = SemiAmbiguouslySpellablePitchSet ((1 ..< count - 1) pitches in PitchSet objectively spellable)
- O = ObjectivelySpellablePitchSet (all pitches in PitchSet objectively spellable)
```
[F F S S F S O F S S F S O O S F O F F S F F]

[F F S S F S O]           [O S F O]
            [O F S S F S O]     [O F F S F F]
```

Use finite state machine to well-define possible transitions from `PitchSet` values with `spellability` values:
- `.objective`
- `.semiAmbiguous`
- `.fullyAmbiguous`

|                | `objective` | `semiAmbiguous`   | `fullyAmbiguous` |
| -------------- | --------- | --------------  | -------------- |
| `objective`      | commit    | add to current  | add to current |
| `semiAmbiguous`  | commit    | add to current  | add to current |
| `fullyAmbiguous` | commit    | add to current  | add to current |


- Only start completely clean after O -> O
- Special case for adjacent linked with `semiAmbiguous`
- Special case for adjacent linked with `objective`
